    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had a need to write some code recently, and ran into the "Rails is a pain to set up" issue that people have been talking about recently. It's gotten bad enough that <a href="http://yehudakatz.com/">Yehuda Katz</a>, a member of the Ruby on Rails core team, has set up a Kickstarter project, <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1397300529/railsapp">"Rails.app"</a>, to address the issue.</p>

<p>Since I'm more familiar with running services on something more like an Amazon EC2 instance, I looked around for something I could put some time and secret sauce into that would give me ease of use and reusability.</p>

<p>That's when I found <a href="http://vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a>.</p>

<p>Vagrant is a way to spin up VMs with standardized environments very quickly. It depends on the wonderful <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">Oracle Virtualbox</a>, and can even integrate <a href="http://www.opscode.com/chef/">Chef</a> or <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/">Puppet</a>.</p>

<p>I'll write a bit more about my experiance with Vagrant soon. You should start looking at it now, though.</p>
